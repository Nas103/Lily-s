# Fixing 404 Error on API Routes

## Issue
The API endpoint `/api/products` returns 404 when accessed via IP address (`192.168.151.240:3000`).

## Solution

The backend needs to be **restarted** after changing `package.json` to bind to `0.0.0.0`.

### Steps:

1. **Stop the current backend:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `npm run dev`

2. **Restart the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd my-store
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Verify it's working:**
   ```bash
   # Test from localhost
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/products
   
   # Test from IP (should work after restart)
   curl http://192.168.151.240:3000/api/products
   ```

4. **Restart Expo:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   npm start
   ```

## Why This Happens

When you change `package.json` to use `-H 0.0.0.0`, Next.js needs to restart to apply the change. The old process was still binding to `localhost` only, which is why:
- `localhost:3000/api/products` works ✅
- `192.168.151.240:3000/api/products` returns 404 ❌

After restarting with the new configuration, both should work.

## Verification

After restarting, you should see in the Next.js terminal:
```
▲ Next.js 14.x.x
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Network:      http://192.168.151.240:3000
```

If you see "Network" with your IP, it's working correctly!
